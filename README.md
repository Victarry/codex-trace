**Codex Trace** is an **OpenAI Codex CLI session log viewer** for local JSONL files stored in `~/.codex/sessions/`.

Browse, search, live-tail, and inspect [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) conversations in a native desktop app and web UI. Codex Trace renders Codex CLI JSONL session files as readable turns with tool calls, token counts, timestamps, collaboration chains, and live SSE tailing for ongoing sessions.

Use Codex Trace when you want to:

- View OpenAI Codex CLI conversation history from `~/.codex/sessions/`
- Browse Codex CLI JSONL session logs without reading raw JSONL files
- Search Codex CLI sessions and messages
- Inspect Codex CLI tool calls, command output, MCP tools, patches, web searches, and image generation events
- Review token usage from previous Codex CLI sessions
- Monitor active Codex CLI sessions in real time
- Debug long-running Codex CLI workflows from a desktop or browser interface
- Support and build a personal AI harness platform such as [DovePaw Lite](https://github.com/PixelPaw-Labs/DovePaw-Lite)

> Codex Trace is also used to support and build [**DovePaw Lite**](https://github.com/PixelPaw-Labs/DovePaw-Lite), a personal AI harness platform for orchestrating local agents.

## Features

- **Codex CLI JSONL viewer** — reads local Codex CLI session files from `~/.codex/sessions/`
- **3-panel layout** — project-grouped session tree → turn list → turn detail
- **Desktop session titles** — displays the Codex title from `session_index.jsonl`
- **Skill and command visibility** — shows observed `SKILL.md` loads and extracts shell commands
  (including Desktop `read` calls wrapped in JavaScript `exec` tools)
- **Session and message search** — find Codex CLI sessions and messages faster than reading raw logs
- **Live tailing** — SSE-based updates for ongoing Codex CLI sessions
- **Tool call inspection** — inspect exec commands, MCP tools, patch apply events, web searches, image generation events, and collaboration agent activity
- **Collaboration tracking** — links orchestrator and worker sessions
- **Token visibility** — shows token counts where available in Codex CLI session data
- **Multiple Codex JSONL formats** — supports new (≥0.44), mid, and oldest (2025/08) session metadata formats
- **Desktop and web modes** — run as a native desktop app or browser-based viewer
- **Docker support** — run headless web mode on port 1422

## Why use Codex Trace?

Codex CLI stores local session history as JSONL files. Those files are useful for debugging and reviewing AI coding sessions, but they are difficult to read directly. Codex Trace turns Codex CLI logs into an interactive session viewer so you can search conversations, inspect tool usage, review token counts, follow collaboration chains, and debug Codex workflows faster.

Unlike general observability platforms, Codex Trace focuses on local Codex CLI session logs from `~/.codex/sessions/`. It does not require sending traces to an external service.

Codex Trace is especially useful when building personal AI harnesses and local agent platforms. It helps inspect Codex CLI sessions, understand tool usage, follow collaboration chains, and debug the workflows that power projects like [DovePaw Lite](https://github.com/PixelPaw-Labs/DovePaw-Lite).

## Install

### Build from source

Use this option if you want to build Codex Trace locally on macOS, Linux, or Windows with Rust and Node.js installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PixelPaw-Labs/codex-trace.git
cd codex-trace
./script/install.sh       # macOS → Codex Trace.app in /Applications; Linux → cargo binary

# Launch the desktop app:
#   macOS:  open -a "Codex Trace"   (or from Launchpad/Applications)
#   Linux:  codex-trace
codex-trace --web         # web mode (opens browser)
```

### Run from source without installing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PixelPaw-Labs/codex-trace.git
cd codex-trace
npm install

npm run tauri dev        # desktop app with hot reload
npm run dev:web          # web mode (opens browser)
```

### Run in Docker

Docker is supported for web mode only.

```bash
docker build -t codex-trace .
docker run --rm -p 1422:1422 \
  -v "$HOME/.codex/sessions:/home/app/.codex/sessions:ro" \
  codex-trace
# then open http://localhost:1422
```

Or with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Session format

Codex Trace reads session files from this default path:

```text
~/.codex/sessions/YYYY/MM/DD/rollout-{ISO_TIMESTAMP}-{UUID}.jsonl
```

Sessions are grouped by their project working directory (`cwd`) in both the sidebar and session
picker. Each session uses its Codex Desktop title from the sibling
`~/.codex/session_index.jsonl` when available, then falls back to the title embedded in older
rollouts, the project name, or the session ID.

Delete a session with the trash button shown on a picker or sidebar row. Codex Trace asks for
confirmation, removes the selected `rollout-*.jsonl` file (and any `.jsonl.zst` sibling), then
refreshes the list. The same action works for local and SSH sessions; remote deletion is constrained
to the configured `ssh://` sessions directory and host.

## Configuration

Press `,` to open Settings and change the sessions directory.

Default sessions directory:

```text
~/.codex/sessions
```

### View sessions on a remote SSH host

Open Settings (press `,`), choose **SSH Remote**, and enter an SSH host alias from your local
`~/.ssh/config` (for example `dev`) plus the remote sessions directory (usually
`~/.codex/sessions`). Codex Trace invokes your local `ssh` client, so your existing SSH keys,
agent, `ProxyJump`, and host configuration are reused; no daemon or installation is required on
the remote server.

The connection is stored as an `ssh://` sessions source. Session metadata is scanned on the remote
host and only the selected rollout is transferred for full parsing. The first picker response uses
the first JSONL record plus `session_index.jsonl`, so it is fast even when the host has gigabytes of
history; a background pass then fills in turns, model, token, ongoing, and worker statistics and
refreshes the picker. SSH connection multiplexing and compression are enabled automatically for
subsequent requests. Remote picker updates are polled periodically because local filesystem
notifications cannot cross an SSH connection. SSH must be usable non-interactively (the app cannot
answer an interactive password or host-key prompt). The remote host needs `python3`; compressed
rollouts additionally need either the `zstd` command or the Python `zstandard` module.

For example:

```text
SSH Host: dev
Remote Sessions Directory: ~/.codex/sessions
```

Environment variables for headless and Docker mode:

| Variable                | Default     | Description                    |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------ |
| `CODEXTRACE_HTTP_HOST`  | `127.0.0.1` | Bind host                      |
| `CODEXTRACE_HTTP_PORT`  | `11424`     | Bind port                      |
| `CODEXTRACE_STATIC_DIR` | —           | Path to built frontend `dist/` |

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # Vite dev server, frontend only
npm run tauri dev    # full Tauri app
```
